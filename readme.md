## atbash-git-branching-practice

this is a project to practice branching with git

some branching commands:

  - `git branch` - shows which branch youre in
  - `git branch name` - creates a branch with that name
  - `git checkout branch name` - checks out the branch called branch-name
  - `git push origin branch-name` - will push to that branch name
